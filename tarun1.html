            <h3><u>ADDENDUM</u></h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Game Design:</h4>
                <p>This game was created as an interactive text-based adventure, with each level presenting choices that lead to unique outcomes. The storyline is centered around escaping a haunted house, featuring various eerie scenarios and twists to keep players engaged.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>HTML Structure:</h4>
                <p>The HTML layout is divided into distinct sections: start screen, game screen, and footer. This clear separation allows easy content manipulation using JavaScript.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>CSS Styling:</h4>
                <p>The CSS was designed to convey a dark and spooky theme, enhancing the haunted house atmosphere. Responsive design principles were applied to ensure it looks good on various screen sizes.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>JavaScript Functionality:</h4>
                <p>JavaScript manages the game’s core functions, including level rendering, player choice handling, and game state management.</p>
                <p>A dynamic rendering system updates the display based on the current level, including text, choices, and images.</p>
                <p>Endgame scenarios display appropriate success or failure messages, with a restart option available.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
                <p>Managing the game’s branching storyline complexity was challenging, but careful structuring of level data and conditional rendering helped achieve the desired outcomes.</p>
                <p>To maintain smooth level transitions and a cohesive story, rigorous testing and debugging were essential.</p>
                <p>Integrating dynamic content, such as the last modified date in the footer, required proficiency in DOM manipulation and JavaScript’s Date object.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Insights Gained:</h4>
                <p>This project highlighted the importance of organized code and modular design, especially for interconnected components.</p>
                <p>I deepened my understanding of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and CSS styling.</p>
                <p>Testing and iterative development were key for refining the player experience and resolving bugs.</p>
