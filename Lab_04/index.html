        <h3>Detection of animals using convolutionary neural network.</h3>
            <p>Vehicle animal collision is most common incident which causes loss to wild life. This intelligent system helps in
                reducing the roadkill during the active nocturnal hours. The system uses thermal image processing using the
                camera mount on the vehicle. It extracts the features of the object in front of the vehicle to detect the animal. The
                main method used to extract the features of the animals is VGG-16. The features are detected by normalizing the
                radiometric image and then processed by finding the magnitude and gradient of a pixel. The extracted features are
                given as an input to the basic deep learning model, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, where binary
                cross-entropy is used to detect the existence of the object. Thus the animal can be detected.

        <H3>Optimized Performance Medical Image Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural
            Networks.</H3>
            <p>In this study, we push towards setup a reproducible analysis pipeline to reveal the impact of deep learning
                techniques on medical image classification performance with deep convolution neural networks. By computing
                the performance of multiple deep learning techniques, we want to compare them to a baseline pipeline and, thus,
                identify possible performance gain. Furthermore, we explore the possible performance impact on multiple
                medical datasets from diverse modalities ranging from histology to X-ray imaging. Our experiments aim to help
                understand the beneficial as well as unfavorable influences of different deep learning techniques on model
                performance. This study contributes to the field of deep understanding and provides detection for ISIC &
                CMNIST histology cancer image classifications.

            <h1>Addendum: CSS Styling Choices</h1>
        </header>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Font Choices</h2>
                <p>The chosen font for the document is Arial, a clean and widely supported sans-serif font. Sans-serif fonts are often preferred for online content due to their readability on screens.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Heading Sizes and Text Size</h2>
                <p>Headings are styled with larger font sizes to create visual hierarchy. Main text is set to 18px for readability. Adjusted heading sizes ensure proper emphasis on section titles.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Color Choices</h2>
                <p>The color scheme includes shades of blue and green. Blue (#3498db) is used for headings and links to create a cohesive look. Green (#2ecc71) is used for emphasizing important elements, such as section titles.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Margin and Padding Choices</h2>
                <p>Margin and padding are added to the body and sections for spacing and readability. Headings and paragraphs have appropriate bottom margins to create a clear separation between content.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2>HTML Element Choices</h2>
                <p>In accordance with the project requirements, all HTML element choices were made based on semantic meaning rather than visual appearance. For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used for the title of the essay to indicate its significance, and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags are used for subsections.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Body Styling</h2>
                <p>background-color: #f9f9f9; color: #333;: Employed a light background and dark text for a balanced, readable interface.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Article Styling</h2>
                <p>Background Alternation (article:nth-of-type): Employed different background colors for odd and even articles to enhance readability and add visual interest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Footer</h2>
                <p>position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;: Fixed positioning ensures the footer stays at the bottom, providing a consistent navigation point. The dark background with light text enhances visibility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>HTML abuse</h2>
                <p>During the initial development, I made another choice in the HTML structure that could be considered an abuse. I used a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag to encapsulate an item in a list solely for styling purposes. While this might have provided the desired visual effect, it deviates from the semantic purpose of HTML elements.</p>
                <p>In the spirit of improving the document structure, I have rectified this by replacing the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag with the appropriate <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag to accurately represent the list item in the HTML structure.</p>
        
            </div>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            var x = document.lastModified;
            document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
